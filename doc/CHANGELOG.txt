## TO DO
   * Simulate diffraction patterns of Pd, CuCl etc. -- simulate_diff_patt.py
   * Finish up check_calibration.py, i.e. overlay fake_calibr... and real calibr images
   * Move control points and experimental details in calibration.py to the data/ directory
   * Copy non-XRD data into data/
   * When all data is copied into data/ with proper file names, and the workflow is finished and tested, upload the data to Zenodo and delete what is on Figshare
   * Ask a few people to test it on their machines
   * At the very end, upload workflow to ... Zenodo or a journal?


## 2019-06-04
   * Separate peak_calc.py into table_Pd.py and functions/peak_calc.py
   * Moved the averaging bit from peak_calc to table_Pd
   * Did a lot of code reorganisation
   * Wrote better function docstrings according to numpy style

## 2019-06-03
   * Changed peak_calc.py to calculate all values in summary table on Pd.
   * Changed azimuthal_integration.py to integrate all XRD scans in data/

## 2019-06-02
   * Renamed all XRD scan files with proper names
   * New bash script data/script_rename.sh to rename all XRD scan files
   * Copied all XRD scans that I want in the workflow

## 2019-06-01
   * New file data/scan_numbers.txt containing a list of XRD scans with their original number and intuitive names to be used in this workflow
   * Replaced 'PS_1p3V' with 'PS_1p3V_b' in file and directory names and inside files (according to names in data/scan_numbers.txt)

## 2019-03-19
   * Made azimuthalIntegrator.patch
   * Uninstalled all Python packages and deleted venv/.  Then created a new virtual environment and reinstalled all packages, applied the patch.  Tested `make analysis`, it worked.

## 2019-03-18
   * Added about 5 images and text to slides
   * Gave talk at THW

## 2019-03-13
   * Wrote script to extract Pd113 peak position for PS_1p3V patterns and calculate average lattice spacing from those
   * Wrote and tested Makefile recipe (`make data`) to download data from Figshare and un-archive it
   * Made one single Makefile in root
   * Described all steps to follow to reproduce the work in README

## 2019-03-12
   * Archived and uploaded data to Figshare (link in Makefile)

## 2019-03-11
   * Wrote and tested script to plot stacks of 1D patterns

## 2019-03-09
   * First working calibration.py using only Python with the pyFAI module
   * Also tried doing it with the command line interface "pyfai-calib", but not happy about it
