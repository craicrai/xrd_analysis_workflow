## TO DO
   * copy all data into data/ and give files proper names
   * change peak_calc.py to calculate all values in summary table Pd113
   * finish up check_calibration.py, i.e. overlay fake_calibr... and real calibr images
   * move control points and experimental details in calibration.py to the data/ directory
   * when all data is copied into data/ with proper file names, and the workflow is finished and tested, upload the data to Zenodo and delete what is on Figshare
   * ask a few people to test it on their machines
   * at the very end, upload workflow to ... Zenodo or a journal?

## 2019-03-19
   * Made azimuthalIntegrator.patch
   * Uninstalled all Python packages and deleted venv/.  Then created a new virtual environment and reinstalled all packages, applied the patch.  Tested `make analysis`, it worked.

## 2019-03-18
   * Added about 5 images and text to slides
   * Gave talk at THW

## 2019-03-13
   * Wrote script to extract Pd113 peak position for PS_1p3V patterns and calculate average lattice spacing from those
   * Wrote and tested Makefile recipe (`make data`) to download data from Figshare and un-archive it
   * Made one single Makefile in root
   * Described all steps to follow to reproduce the work in README

## 2019-03-12
   * Archived and uploaded data to Figshare (link in Makefile)

## 2019-03-11
   * Wrote and tested script to plot stacks of 1D patterns

## 2019-03-09
   * First working calibration.py using only Python with the pyFAI module
   * Also tried doing it with the command line interface "pyfai-calib", but not happy about it
